# Newtons Forward Difference MATLAB
A function for interpolating polynomials. 
In other words, you provide an array of X values, and an array of Y values that a certain function will pass through (any function with an upwards trend), so the X and Y values are basically 'points' that you know the function will pass through or 'interpolate', and then this function will return any approximate Y value 'approx_y' at the specified 'x' value.
